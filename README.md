## Log

### Day 1: February 23, 2019, Saturday

**Link to work:** 
- [virtualenv](https://github.com/mimukit/html5-templates-collection#1-flat-login-template "Flat Login Template")

**New thing(s) learned:** 
- how to use vitrualenv package
- windows commands:
    - type = cat
    - which = where
    - ls = dir
- new pip commands:
    - pip list 
    - pip freeze > requirements.txt
    - pip install -r file.txt

**Thoughts:**  ***Taken from Effective Python 59 ways, chapter 53:***
 - Virtual environments allow you to use pip to install many different versions of the same package on the same machine without conflicts.
- Virtual environments are created with pyvenv, enabled with source
bin/activate, and disabled with deactivate.
- You can dump all of the requirements of an environment with pip freeze. You can reproduce the environment by supplying the requirements.txt file to pip 
install -r.
- In versions of Python before 3.4, the pyvenv tool must be downloaded and
installed separately. The command-line tool is called virtualenv instead of
pyvenv.
